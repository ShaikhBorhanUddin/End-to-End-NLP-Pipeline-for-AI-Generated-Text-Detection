mean no more than just get from point p to point b. cars play much nigger impact than it may seem . they affect not only the person drive , nut the people around it . they also have a negative impact on the greenhouse gas . so rid a bicycle to work one day , will not just n good for you , it will also n good for the surround environment . car have become a universal item . p lot of people have they , not no really give they much thought . there be a few place that have spend the time and really develop way to keep a community clean without the hazardous fume come from the car exhaust . for example , vauban , germany have develop a system where car be ban . the only place you can keep your car be on the outskirt of town in designate garage . due to this , most people do not even have a car , and have choose to sell it before move in . in bogot , columbia they have a develop a day free of car where anyone that drive a car would have to pay a fine . accord to the governor it be an amazing thing and everyone be participate in it . this also help get some the nasty gas that they produce away . car give of hazardous gas throw their exhaust . these gas will rise and get catch in the ozone . which impact the environment greatly in more way than one . it can cause the air your breathing to n toxic . it also be one of the main reason for global warming . paris learn this the hard when they reach record level pollution . they decide they have no choice nut to nan half the car one day and nan the other half the next day . after this the congestion be down 60 , prove that it have help greatly . just imagine if one day instead of drive you could ride a nike and help change the environment . place have try to develop way to reduce the level or gas . some have be very successful , for example , in bogot and vauban they have find creative way to help . the question be whether car should n do with all together . to that I would have to say no , car play a nig part in get to work on time or travel . take car away would mean take away family trip and other fun thing to do with car . the real answer to the question be that car should not become so much of a necessity . there should n way for people to get around netter without the use of car .\",\n          \"when make life decision , it be important to seek advice from other before make a move . this be because

Text-Based Feature Engineering:\n","\n","*   **Bag of Words (BoW) Features**: Generated using `CountVectorizer` on the `cleaned_text` column.\n","    *   **Shape**: `bow_features.shape` is (20877, 38038).\n","    *   **Description**: This matrix represents the frequency of each word in the vocabulary across all documents. Each row corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds to a unique word. The values indicate how many times a word appears in a document.\n","\n","*   **TF-IDF Features**: Generated using `TfidfVectorizer` on the `cleaned_text` column.\n","    *   **Shape**: `tfidf_features.shape` is (20877, 38038).\n","    *   **Description**: This matrix contains the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency scores for each word in each document. TF-IDF gives more weight to words that are frequent in a document but rare across all documents, helping to highlight important words that are specific to certain texts.\n","\n","*   **Word2Vec Model**: Trained on the `cleaned_text` column.\n","    *   **Vocabulary Size**: The model learned embeddings for 12,664 unique words.\n","    *   **Embedding Dimension**: Each word is represented by a 100-dimensional vector.\n","    *   **Description**: Word2Vec captures semantic relationships between words by representing them as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. Words with similar meanings are located closer to each other in this space. These embeddings can be aggregated (e.g., averaged) per document to create document-level features.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Utility in Enhancing Overall Model Learning**: By combining these stylometric features with content-based features (BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec), a machine learning model can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the text. The numerical features provide a high-level overview of the text's structure and readability, while the text-based features delve into its semantic content. This multi-faceted approach allows the model to learn from both _what_ is being said and _how_ it is being said, leading to more robust and accurate classification, especially for distinguishing between human and AI-generated text."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"8d69758a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1766754874192,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":39,"user":{"displayName":"Shaikh Borhan Uddin","userId":"10957918931598350820"}},"outputId":"a0431da6-981c-4086-ef40-d3cdb4ce1e9e"},"source":["display(df_combined_lemmatized.head())"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["   label  length_chars  length_words  punctuation_ratio  repetition_score  \\\n","0      0           126            22           0.031746          0.045455   \n","1      1           141            19           0.014184          0.000000   \n","2      0           112            17           0.026786          0.000000   \n","3      1           101            14           0.009901          0.000000   \n","4      0            78            14           0.025641          0.000000   \n","\n","                                                text  \\\n","0  as someone who follow food , I believe privacy...   \n","1  analysis indicate that travel be associate wit...   \n","2  I recently experience education in my day to d...   \n","3  analysis indicate that sport be associate with...   \n","4  in my experience , finance often lead to user ...   \n","\n","                                        cleaned_text  \n","0  someone follow food , believe privacy concern ...  \n","1  analysis indicate travel associate privacy con...  \n","2  recently experience education day day life fin...  \n","3  analysis indicate sport associate cost vary gr...  \n","4  experience , finance often lead user report mi...
